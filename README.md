## Getting Started 🚀

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites 📋

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.\
Also you need to have installed [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
gatsby-cli@2.8.22 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ☝️
